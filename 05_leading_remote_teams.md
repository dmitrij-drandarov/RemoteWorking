# Leading remote teams
- often and especially in agile projects: Leader not necessarily (project) manager
- content in this chapter derived from my experiences as "technical teamlead"

## Leading by example
![alt text](slides/1280px-Bell_X-1_46-062_(in_flight).jpg)

- always on time
- always ask if team member has time for a talk instead of just "rushing in"
- "pilot voice",
    - originated by Chuck Yeager, US Air Force pilot, first one to break sound barrier
    - speech pattern emulated by individual pilots without explicit instruction to do so
    - cool, collected, "down-home calmness", relaxed, in-charge, unconcerned

## Trust equation
![alt_text](slides/trustEquation.png)
- credibility = "Can I believe what a person says?"
- reliability = "Do I believe that they deliver?"
- intimacy = "Do I feel safe and secure with a person?"

- increase reliability:
    - Verify Skills: 
        - technical and collaboration skills
        - asking "Are you comfortable doing this task?", "Do you have any concerns about this project?"
    - Be Explicit
        - with expectations and requests
        - about content and timeframe 
    - Lead by Example
    - Count on Others
        - trust in others creates reliability
- increase intimacy:
    - = "likeability"
    - Get Personal
        - learn team members on a personal level: learn about families, vacation plans, hobbies
        - informal discussions and meetings
        - leading by example: let the cat run over your desk during a meeting :)
    - Encourage Social Interactions
        - remote = less "water cooler effect"
        - spend time talking about "stuff" each meeting
        - share small gifts (articles, videos etc.)
    - Over-communicate
    - Meet Face to Face
    - Be Positive

## Delegation
- excursion into Getting things done: "the 3 Ds" = Delete, Delegate, Do (in this order)
- generally important to do delegation right, but especially with remote teams

### Example dialog
- communicate reason of delegation: "I have this other important deadline coming up, that's why I cannot do this task by myself"
- communicate reason of why delegation to this person: "You've worked on this module before, so you know it well."
- communicate goal, not task: "The module repeatedly generates bugs. The team says it has become too complicated and needs refactoring."
- clear deadline: "Because our sprint ends in one week, I need the refactoring done in three days."
- communicate resources ("Talk to John, he can help you", "If you have to buy this analysis software, you may spend 100$ for it")
- get commitment, don't command: "That's the task. Do you want to do it?"
- "Do you have any questions about this?"
- always say thank you: "Thanks! You really helped me out here!"
- have task repeated back: "Just to make sure I haven't missed anything, could you please repeat back to me what your task is?"

### Deadlines
- Parkinson's Law: tasks will take as long as there is time
- => always set a deadline
- be reasonable
- set specific deadline: "I need this done by Friday, June 9 at 3pm US Eastern Time", not "in the next few days"
- provides "natural" timeframe after which a request about the progress makes sense => manageability
 
## How to assign tasks - avoid "Thy Bystander Effect"
- Kitty Genovese: 1964, New York City, attacked 3 times within 30 minutes - 38 witnesses, not one of them called police
- "The Bystander Effect" - the greater number of bystanders, the less chance of help
- = "everyone's responsibility = noone's responsibility" 
- always give responsibility to specific people
- use direct language: "I need you to work on this task", not "I think we should work on this task"
- assign to individuals, not groups

## "Because"
- "Xerox study": line before a copy machine
    1. "Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine, because I'm in a rush?" => 94% compliance
    1. "Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine?" => 60%
    1. "Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine, because I have to make copies?" => 93%
- third request ridiculous because everyone in line had to make copies
- however successful because of "because"
- => use "because" consistently in communication
- "Please schedule a meeting for next week because we have to discuss our strategy"
- "Please finish this document until tomorrow 10 a.m. because I need to review it"
 
## Regular one-on-ones
TODO Bild: zwei gegenübersitzende Schreibtische, Headsets
- project-entry talk:
    - background?
    - goals?
    - "How can I support you?"
    - state time at which an update-talk will happen
- update talk:
    - development from last meeting
    - new plans for future?
- my experience: offshore developers often more focused on personal gain and development, more open to change if positive for own development => very important to know the real motivation!
- all of those talks with the maximum amount of presence: best would be a physical face-to-case meeting. If remote: video + audio
- attention: make sure one-on-ones happen in separated rooms so the team cannot hear what is talked about (don't let your co-worker sit on his usual desk in the office besides his colleagues)  

## Connection with actual customer
TODO weinender customer vor leerem Schreibtisch
- setting in my team: extremely "local-thinking" customer, since forever all hired developers co-located, high amount of direct and immediate communication in office
- gain: insight in mood and circumstances
- remote workers: no connection of that sort to customer
- approaches (!) to resolve this situation:
    - let remote team participate in meetings, at least part of the time
    - let remote team members present their stories in sprint review
    - have remote team visit city and facilities of customer at least once at project start, better regularly
    - state names of team members in meetings so the customer knows them as individuals, not just "the indian development team"
    - have remote team members use actual profile pictures in systems like JIRA so that the customer knows them
    - if customer really understands Scrum: offer him to participate in dailies, however just as a guest
