# Leading remote teams
TODO Bild ??
- often and especially in agile projects: Leader not necessarily (project) manager
- content in this chapter derived from my experiences as "technical teamlead"

## Leading by example
TODO Bild: flying jet
- always on time
- always ask if team member has time for a talk instead of just "rushing in"
- "pilot voice",
    - originated by Chuck Yeager, US Air Force pilot, first one to break sound barrier
    - speech pattern emulated by individual pilots without explicit instruction to do so
    - cool, collected, "down-home calmness", relaxed, in-charge, unconcerned

## Trust equation
TODO Equation as image
- TODO Bild malen: trustworthiness = (credibility + reliability + intimacy) / self orientation. credibility = "Can I believe what a person says?", reliability = "Do I believe that they deliver?", intimacy = "Do I feel safe and secure with a person?"

## Delegation
TODO Bild
- excursion into Getting things done: "the 3 Ds" = Delete, Delegate, Do (in this order)
- generally important to do delegation right, but especially with remote teams

### Example dialog
- communicate reason of delegation: "I have this other important deadline coming up, that's why I cannot do this task by myself"
- communicate reason of why delegation to this person: "You've worked on this module before, so you know it well."
- communicate goal, not task: "The module repeatedly generates bugs. The team says it has become too complicated and needs refactoring."
- clear deadline: "Because our sprint ends in one week, I need the refactoring done in three days."
- communicate resources ("Talk to John, he can help you", "If you have to buy this analysis software, you may spend 100$ for it")
- get commitment, don't command: "That's the task. Do you want to do it?"
- "Do you have any questions about this?"
- always say thank you: "Thanks! You really helped me out here!"
- have task repeated back: "Just to make sure I haven't missed anything, could you please repeat back to me what your task is?"
 
## Regular one-on-ones
TODO Bild: zwei gegenübersitzende Schreibtische, Headsets
- project-entry talk:
    - background?
    - goals?
    - "How can I support you?"
    - state time at which an update-talk will happen
- update talk:
    - development from last meeting
    - new plans for future?
- my experience: offshore developers often more focused on personal gain and development, more open to change if positive for own development => very important to know the real motivation!
- all of those talks with the maximum amount of presence: best would be a physical face-to-case meeting. If remote: video + audio

## Connection with actual customer
TODO weinender customer vor leerem Schreibtisch
- setting in my team: extremely "local-thinking" customer, since forever all hired developers co-located, high amount of direct and immediate communication in office
- gain: insight in mood and circumstances
- remote workers: no connection of that sort to customer
- approaches (!) to resolve this situation:
    - let remote team participate in meetings, at least part of the time
    - let remote team members present their stories in sprint review
    - have remote team visit city and facilities of customer at least once at project start, better regularly
    - state names of team members in meetings so the customer knows them as individuals, not just "the indian development team"
    - have remote team members use actual profile pictures in systems like JIRA so that the customer knows them
    - if customer really understands Scrum: offer him to participate in dailies, however just as a guest
