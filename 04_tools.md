# Tools
- misconception, that it's just about the tools
- requirements:
  - text
  - voice
  - video
  - screen sharing (code review, presenting)
  - good audio
  - knowing everyones current status
  - collaborative working: Skype whiteboard, Etherpad, Piratepad
- hardware:
  - multiple monitors (one just for video stream)
  - great cam
  - great mic
  - great headset
- software:
  - shared calender (Outlook, Google)
  - Skype (show audio settings to check if mic is working + different views in meeting room to see everybody simultaneously)
  - teamview
  - Slack Chat
  - document management for ALL documents

## How to use the tools
- In case of group-wide failure: have a backup communication channel (SlackChat if Skype fails) + recovery strategy ("If Skype fails to connect to our meeting room, let's meet in Slack and talk about what to do")
- In case of individual failure: for every team member, have a way to connect (best backup: telephone)
- establish a procedure for interrupts, for example ringing door bell during group conversation: write "Someone is at the door, brb" into the group-wide chat. => current speaker is not disturbed + everyone knows what's going on
