- use status messages in your messager (Skype etc) => "Free for chat" (ICQ) vs "I'm busy" => that's not even possible in "the real world" except you put a sticker on your forehead
- when videochatting with multiple people, direct the camera to the person speaking. Alternatively, deactivate automatic zoom.
- at the beginning of the workshop: Ask wishes, hopes, fears from participants. Talk them through, together. Participants are (kind of) trainers themselves - every team is different and something can be learned from each situation
- introduction into workshop: report own story: 
1. 1h communte without possibility of remote work
1. Cluj-team
1. internal technical problems => home office => local separation!
1. thought: If I can work from anywhere, I also can work at any moment in time => working sundays => time separation!

TODO: Have a look at Collaboration super Powers website: Free online courses available

- Workshop should be very communicative. Ask participants at the beginning:
    - Are you currently working in a remote team?
    - If yes, in what role?
    - How big is your team?
    - On how many locations is your team located?
    - What are your main problems?
    - What are your main questions?
    - What are your main concerns?
