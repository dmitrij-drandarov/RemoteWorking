# How to make it work
- Warning: Not for everyone! Remember time right before your final tests? Bet your rooms have never been that clean. ;) Beware of procrastination!
- Proactively fight social isolation
- overlapping timezones
- declare "default-timezone". What is meant with "Let's meet at 8 a.m.?"
- complete transparency (especially for documents). There's no "just go over to Sven and ask him" because Sven is in Helsinki and sleeping right now.
- virtual water cooler
- force employees to stop working: "Just checking mails right after dinner with my family" very dangerous
- Don't get flabby: when working from home, no more walks to the cantine and less traveling to the water cooler = health issues! 
- employers: organize meetups at least 2 times a year, multiple days. People have to meet in person! Have activities for working together, meeting the customer together, having fun together. See https://stevenschwenke.de/theFirstGetTogetherOfMeAndMyRemoteTeam
- employers: train the commonly used language with ongoing language courses
- have a real-life meeting at the beginning of the project
- with that first meeting: begin to build trust
- don't stop there: trust has to be groomed and buid further
- have a look at open source projects: all remote, a lot of them awesome and used worldwide. These are endlessly more complex than most of the "business" applications you will work on.
- if only part of team remote: treat them like equals because they are equals! Get rid of technical impediments, improve social skills of the whole (!) team, meet in person.
- everyone involved must be a pro in communication because a big part of inter-human communication is not available remotely (gesture, facial expression, surroundings, smell, hearing everything, ...)
- => know how to communicate your expectations to your coworkers
- learn how to write emails ("I'm sorry this mail is so long, I couldn't take the time to shorten it") and leave voice messages ("Influencing virtual teams" p. 44)
- learn how to organize meetings (necessary? goal, agenda, participants, postprocessing)
- employers: coach first-time remote-working teams. For example: learn how to screenshare: don't move the mouse unless you want to point to something, navigatore more slowly, speak as if you're giving an interview
- invite the customer to webmeetings to build trust. "Seeing is believing", that goes for your coworkers as well!
- way more documentation of the processes used - leads automatically to more professional development!
- use an agile process with daily meetings and self-organizing teams
- decide if you want to "just throw over" predefined packages of work or if you want to be a real team where everyone is equal
- know all holidays of the countries your teammates work in and make them public to everyone in the team
- "invest in beginnings": freshly created remote working teams need more time for the "storming" phase in which roles and rules are created. This time has to be accounted for and planned upfront.
- at least teamleaders, better everyone in the team has to be coached in solving conflicts because these are harder to solve from distance
- coaching of communication of cultural differences and how to deal with them (for example different understand of what "9 am" means: "Indian time" or "German time"?)
