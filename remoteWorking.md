#What is it about?
- home office
- remote working (in German "verteiltes Arbeiten")
- virtual team
- not just local changes, also temporal changes, for example opposite of "9 to 5"
- "The future is already here - it's just not evenly distributed" (William Gibson) - what we're talking about here is the present. Don't let anybody tell you "maybe in the future". Companies with remote workers: ebay, IBM, Accenture (see "Remote" p. 80)
- reason: only applies to knowledge workers with creative and thoughtful work
- offices = invention from the 18th and 19th century
- nowadays, at least for knowledge workers, office = interruption factory
- "real work" is done alone in the quite / in coffee shops
- 400h commute time per year = time to develop "basecamp" (https://launchpad.37signals.com/basecamp)
- relatively new concept because technology only available since a couple of years: internet, cheap fast portable computers, webcamps, headsets, ...

#Reputation
- employees: Wanna have!
- employers: (often) no-go
- "good ideas only when you are all in one room" - compare to several (american) films where crisis squads lock themselfes into a room and force a solution
- big topic: trust. Employer "How can I trust them to work?" - Why would you want to work for a boss that doesn't trust you? Why would he want to hire people he can't trust? Real fear: Loss of control, power, influence, right of existence of some managers
- security: What is more valuable: An encrypted laptop or a demotivated emplyoer? Knowledge is in the heads, not the hardware. However, "safe" VPN and infrastructure is necessary. security checklist of 37signals:
  - all computers drive encryption
  - disable automatic login + logout after 10 minutes
  - encryption for every site visited (TLS)
  - all smart phones and laptops have lock codes and can be wipped remotely
  - only use generated passwords that are managed via password safe
  - two factor authentication (additional dongle or app for pin)
 


#Consequences
##If it works
- employer:
  - only gets the most productive hours
  - in comparison to 9 to 5: employer pays for sitting on chair in a specific time slot
  - gets the best of the best - worldwide
  - ("Remote" p. 31) "Working outside the Box", IBM white paper, 2009: 1,9 billion $ from selling office space + > 1 billion $ less leasing per year
  - chance to keep employees who move due to family reasons
- employee:
  - choosing when to "work": only invoice most productive hours, sleep / play / go shopping in the meantime
  - "new luxury": go surfing everyday while working for a company in Norway instead of the nice loft in the city of your employer.
  - ("Remote" p. 32) telecommuter 10.000$ per year less costs for commuting

##If it doesn't work
- employee invoices his long lunch breaks and idle time
- think: What would an employer most likely notice: the third consecutive missed deadline because of laziness or a friendly, ever-present employee who doesn't do anything?
- remote working focuses on the work done, not how you can sell yourself with chitchat in the office.

##Other
- during industrialization: growth of cities (because that's where factories are)
- during information age: working from your cabin in the woods (with satellite internet)

#How to make it work
- Warning: Not for everyone! Remember time right before your final tests? Bet your rooms have never been that clean. ;) Beware of procrastination!
- Proactively fight social isolation
- overlapping timezones
- complete transparency (especially for documents). There's no "just go over to Sven and ask him" because Sven is in Helsinki and sleeping right now.
- virtual water cooler
- force employees to stop working: "Just checking mails right after dinner with my family" very dangerous
- Don't get flabby: when working from home, no more walks to the cantine and less traveling to the water cooler = health issues! 
- employers: organize meetups at least 2 times a year, multiple days. People have to meet in person! Have activities for working together, meeting the customer together, having fun together. See https://stevenschwenke.de/theFirstGetTogetherOfMeAndMyRemoteTeam
- employers: train the commonly used language with ongoing language courses
- have a real-life meeting at the beginning of the project
- with that first meeting: begin to build trust
- don't stop there: trust has to be groomed and buid further
- have a look at open source projects: all remote, a lot of them awesome and used worldwide. These are endlessly more complex than most of the "business" applications you will work on.
- if only part of team remote: treat them like equals because they are equals! Get rid of technical impediments, improve social skills of the whole (!) team, meet in person.
- everyone involved must be a pro in communication because a big part of inter-human communication is not available remotely (gesture, facial expression, surroundings, smell, hearing everything, ...)
- => know how to communicate your expectations to your coworkers
- learn how to write emails ("I'm sorry this mail is so long, I couldn't take the time to shorten it") and leave voice messages ("Influencing virtual teams" p. 44)
- learn how to organize meetings (necessary? goal, agenda, participants, postprocessing)
- employers: coach first-time remote-working teams. For example: learn how to screenshare: don't move the mouse unless you want to point to something, navigatore more slowly, speak as if you're giving an interview
- invite the customer to webmeetings to build trust. "Seeing is believing", that goes for your coworkers as well!
- way more documentation of the processes used - leads automatically to more professional development!
- use an agile process with daily meetings and self-organizing teams
- decide if you want to "just throw over" predefined packages of work or if you want to be a real team where everyone is equal
- know all holidays of the countries your teammates work in and make them public to everyone in the team
- "invest in beginnings": freshly created remote working teams need more time for the "storming" phase in which roles and rules are created. This time has to be accounted for and planned upfront.
- at least teamleaders, better everyone in the team has to be coached in solving conflicts because these are harder to solve from distance
- coaching of communication of cultural differences and how to deal with them (for example different understand of what "9 am" means: "Indian time" or "German time"?)

#Tools
- misconception, that it's just about the tools
- requirements:
  - text
  - voice
  - video
  - screen sharing (code review, presenting)
  - good audio
  - knowing everyones current status
- hardware:
  - multiple monitors (one just for video stream)
  - great cam
  - great mic
  - great headset
- software:
  - shared calender (Outlook, Google)
  - Skype
  - teamview
  - Slack Chat
  - document management for ALL documents

#Variations
- remote work != another country / continent. Imagine just working part time and not driving to work for just 3 hours.
- working from onsite (location of customer) = working from inside the office = working from home
- => remote = state of mind. Enable it and see what happens!

#Current situation in Germany
- more and more need for nearshore (for example Romania) or offshore (for example China or India) in Germany
- reason: cost reduction from german industry
- consequence in german IT: customer contact, analysis and creation of requirements furthermore in Germany, also decision-making about architectures and technologies. Implementation however more and more offsite.
- => more need for coordination and communication in management
- more need for understanding business logic for every consultant in Germany

#What does that mean to you, my dear students?
- You will be compared to people from all over the world. Find your niche and be awesome!
- Employers will hire people who write well. Learn that!
- It's more and more about communication. Visit every communication course you can, especially when being a student.
